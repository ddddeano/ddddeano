# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel (@ddddeano)

I’m the creator of **FIReUX** — a modular, multi-tenant SaaS architecture built on **Nuxt + Firebase**.  
My work sits at the intersection of framework design, ecosystem building, and real-world product development.

FIReUX is not just a library — it’s a foundation.  
I design the systems that power connected apps like **Misebox**, **Cleanbox**, and future ecosystems built on shared domains such as profiles, jobs, agents, tasks, locations, teams, and more.

My role spans:
- architecting how data flows between core and tenant apps  
- designing universal domain engines that work across industries  
- building UI systems that remain consistent across ecosystems  
- creating the standards that determine how apps grow within FIReUX  
- shaping the long-term vision for a framework that grows with its users  

## 🔥 What I Actually Do
- Full architecture of FIReUX core (users, apps, profiles, permissions)  
- Cross-ecosystem engines (jobs, agents, professionals, suppliers, chefs)  
- Domain-driven modelling for tasks, locations, and scheduling  
- Component systems for preview/edit flows across all entities  
- Multi-tenant logic that allows apps to share identity but remain isolated  
- Building real apps (Misebox, Cleanbox, Richies, others) on the same stack  

## 🎯 Current Focus
Unifying every domain—profiles, jobs, tasks, locations—into a coherent system so any app built on FIReUX can grow into a full ecosystem with minimal duplication.

## 🌱 Philosophy
FIReUX is built for developers like me:  
people who want **order, clarity, scale, and elegance** in their tools — not chaos, boilerplate, or throwaway code.

## 🤝 Collaboration
I enjoy working with others on:
- Nuxt architecture  
- Firebase multi-tenant design  
- SaaS frameworks & domain engines  
- Real-world app modelling
